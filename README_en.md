# kanon_httpd
## Introduction
`kanon_httpd` is a simple http server. The server can only run on linux/unix-like platform only since does so `kanon`.
It can accept and process http request including `GET`, `POST`. 
Also, it support long connection and short connection(i.e. `keep-alive` header).
Compared to the old approach `CGI` to back dynamic pages, I apply the modern approach `Shared object` as `plugin` to provide them. The content provider need implemetes the [interface class](https://github.com/Conzxy/kanon_httpd/blob/master/src/plugin/http_dynamic_response_interface.h) to the `*/kanon_httpd/resource/contents` only, then build tool will generate `plugin` automatically.

## Options
The server supports some options, you can type `--help` to look it:
(The command options is powered by [takina](https://github.com/Conzxy/takina))
```shell
$ ./httpd --help
```

## Build
I wrote two version of it, but the version 1 has not been maintained. Therefore the version2 is the default build target.

This project depends on [`kanon`](https://github.com/Conzxy/kanon). You must install it first. Besides, The project is built by `cmake`ï¼Œso you also need to install `cmake`.

I prepare a shell script in the project directory, it should meet the basic requirements of build, also you can modify it.

## Run Test
Open a web browser, and input the URL: `http://Hostname/` will access the home page.
I prepare one dynamic page: `adder` that is very simple page.
You can access this page by following approach:
* `GET` method: `http://Hostname/contents/adder?a=*&b=*`
* `POST` method: `http://Hostname/html/post_test.html/` and fill the form and submit, then httpd will back dynamic page like `GET` approach.
